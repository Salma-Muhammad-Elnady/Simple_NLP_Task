# **The performance of each model is compared by creating simple random reviews and classifying restaurant reviews as positive or negative**

## Project description :
_______________________
For this straightforward project, we created a model to categorise restaurant 
reviews as either positive or negative, employing various types of recurrent neural networks (RNN, LSTM and GRU) via the Keras library.

## Text processing :
___________________
The data was prepared by converting text into numbers using Tokenization, 
standardising their lengths using padding, and then training and comparing the performance of different models.

## Task objectives:
___________________
The aim of this project is to understand how to handle textual data in deep learning, 
to build simple natural language processing (NLP) models, and to assess the performance of each model with the data.
